# INSTRUCTION.md — Owner-side How-To Playbook

This file holds **owner-executable instructions**: step-by-step, line-by-line,
command-by-command guides that let YOU (the project owner) do the work by hand
that the AI agent would otherwise do. The agent's job is to **instruct** — to
write the how-to — not to perform the task.

## Convention (governed by `AGENTS.md`)

- **Append-only.** When the owner asks the agent to *prepare an instruction*
  for a task, the agent **appends** a new self-contained block to the **end** of
  this file (newest last, oldest first — same convention as `LOG.md` /
  `PROMPTS.md`). It never reads back and rewrites or replaces prior blocks.
- **Numbering.** Each block is headed `INSTR #N — <short title>` with a date.
  `N` increments with every append. The agent determines the next `N` by
  finding the highest existing `INSTR #N` header (a targeted header lookup,
  not a full re-read of prior content).
- **Voice.** Blocks are written in the second person, to the owner
  ("you run …", "edit `file.py:line` …"), covering: exact commands (with the
  right env python), where to edit and how, how to run the smoke test, and the
  expected output / how to verify.
- **Trigger.** The agent writes an instruction only on the owner's explicit
  request (e.g. "prepare an instruction for X"), after clarifying the specific
  task/approach when needed. It does not append one automatically for every task
  it executes.
- **Tracking.** The file is tracked and committed under the explicit `_run/0_lcb`
  pathspec; every append also gets an entry in `LOG.md`.
