## 2026-08-22 — Session 1: Scaffold + repair plan + serialization validation

### Goal (user-confirmed via clarify)
Reproduce/extend `_run/7_lcbnovel_mgofe` as a clean, documented project under the
AI-Agent Project Workflow (human README + AI README + LOG + TUTORIAL). Scope:
**faithful repair** (same Fe/MgO stack, 25 Fe on fixed MgO, GPAW), heavy run to be
launched on the HPC cluster (PJM, 64-core), NOT this session. Dual logging requested.

### Discovery — run 7 and run 6 never actually ran
- Read `7_lcbnovel_mgofe/j_novel.sh.6543317.out`: crashed at **seed 3** with
  `TypeError: Could not serialize the put value <LowerConfidenceBoundCalculator>:
  cannot pickle 'sqlite3.Connection' object`. No `seed_*/` dirs exist.
- Timestamp analysis: the acquisitor fix (module-level free functions + partial) is
  present in `7_lcbnovel_mgofe/novelty_lcb/acquisitor.py` (modified 16:00) but the
  crash log is from 15:48 — **the fix landed after the failed run and was never
  re-tested on a real run.** This is the core risk in "faithful repair".
- `6_lcbnovel_benchmark/j_bench.sh.6544501.out`: crashed on the `calc`→`calculator`
  kwarg bug (Bug C); `FIX_README.md` documents the fix but no
  `benchmark_results_surface/` dir exists — also never re-run.
- **Conclusion:** neither prior project ever completed a real search. Run 7 is a
  *broken-to-be-fixed* reproduction, not a working one to copy.

### Verification of the serialization root cause
- Read `agox/models/ABC_model.py`: `GPR.__init__(database=...)` calls
  `attach_to_database(database)`, which only does `self.attach(database)` (observer
  wiring) and does **not** store `self.database`. So the GPR pickles cleanly even
  when constructed with `database=`. Confirms the DB connection only leaks through
  objects that store a DB reference — exactly the acquisitor's bound methods.

### Actions taken
1. Copied `novelty_lcb/` package (acquisitor.py, utils.py, common.py,
   benchmark_helpers.py, __init__.py) and `scripts/` builders
   (build_mgo_stack, build_fe_stack, build_heteroStruct, hetero_struct_randomize,
   plot_structure) from `7_lcbnovel_mgofe/` into `10_lcbnovel/`.
   → `REUSE the proven package` (user decision), lowest risk.
2. Wrote `main.py` — faithful to run 7's physics (A_MGO, A_FE, dist_z, supercell (5,5,1),
   kpts (1,1,1), 1 MgO layer + 1 Fe layer, kappa=2, N_iterations=100) with:
   - **serialization-safe wiring** (fixed acquisitor, positional `calculator`),
   - per-seed CLI + range, so HPC can launch one seed per job.
3. Wrote `smoke_test_serialization.py` — cheap local test (EMT, tiny Au system,
   **no GPAW**) that walks the exact crash path:
   `NoveltyLCBAcquisitor → get_acquisition_calculator() → ParallelRelaxPostprocess`.
4. Wrote `j_novel.sh` — PJM batch script (64-core, agox_v2, one seed per job,
   `SEED` env override). Fixed the run-7 env mismatch: `gpaw_env` → `agox_v2`.
5. Wrote docs: `README.md`, `README.AI.md`, `LOG.md` (this file), `TUTORIAL.md`.

### Results
- `py_compile main.py novelty_lcb/*.py scripts/*.py` → **ALL COMPILE OK** (agox_v2).
- `smoke_test_serialization.py` → **RESULT: PASS**:
  - `pickle.dumps(calc)` OK (no sqlite in graph)
  - Ray serializability report clean (0 FAIL)
  - `ParallelRelaxPostprocess(model=calc)` constructed OK
  - end-to-end 2-iteration AGOX run with EMT completed, **no** Ray serialization error.
- **Grounding:** the run-7 crash root cause is verified fixed at the code level.

### Decisions & reasoning
- **Reuse the run-7 package** rather than rewriting: it already contains the fix and
  the physics is proven; rewriting risks reintroducing Bugs A/B/C.
- **Faithful repair** (not improvement): user explicitly chose same stack, get it
  working. Downstream NS/novel-filter hooks deferred.
- **One seed per PJM job**: the sampler/pool is effectively per-seed; scale-out by
  array submission (matches the run-8 multiseed guide's "many independent jobs").

### Open items / next steps
- [ ] Calibrate the Novelty-LCB energy window from a short standard-LCB run
      (target = band centre, ΔE ≈ 0.5–1.0 eV). Placeholder `0.0 / 1.0` is a TODO.
- [ ] Launch the heavy Fe/MgO search on HPC (pjsub, one seed per job).
- [ ] After calibration + runs: downstream analysis (nested sampling / novel filter).

### Time
Recon + scaffold + validation ≈ 25 min.

## 2026-08-22 — Session 1b: Add governing rule file (AGENTS.md)

### Goal (user-confirmed via clarify)
Write a persistent rule file in this project that any AI agent will read and work
according to. User provided the AI-Agent Project Workflow as the governing process.
Confirmed: filename **AGENTS.md**; scope = the workflow rule only (README human +
AI, LOG, TUTORIAL); it **references** (does not replace) `README.AI.md` and `LOG.md`.

### Actions taken
- Created `AGENTS.md` — governing rules for AI agents:
  - Core principle: three deliverables must coexist (README human + AI, Log, Tutorial).
  - Sections for each deliverable, mapped to this project's actual files
    (`README.md`, `README.AI.md`, `LOG.md` + `transcript.log`, `TUTORIAL.md`).
  - Rules of operation: clarify-before-every-step, ground in repo, keep deliverables
    current, append-only log, verify before claiming done, code/docs tracked vs
    regenerable data, no commit without asking.
  - Invariant environment block + skill pointers.
  - Relationship to `ai-agent-reminder-system`.

### Results
- `AGENTS.md` written (3.9 KB). Verified on disk.

### Decisions & reasoning
- **AGENTS.md** is the conventional filename AI agents auto-read, so a future agent
  will discover the rules without being told.
- Kept it as the *governing process* and left `README.AI.md` as the *machine spec*
  and `LOG.md` as the *action log* — three complementary, single-purpose files
  rather than one monolithic rule dump (user's explicit choice).

### Open items / next steps
- Unchanged from Session 1: calibrate energy window, then launch heavy HPC search.

### Time
~5 min.

## 2026-08-22 — Session 1c: Git commit rule + initial commit

### Goal (user-confirmed via clarify)
1. Add a git-commit rule to `AGENTS.md`: commit after every change.
2. Make the initial git commit for the whole `10_lcbnovel` scaffold.

Confirmed: the rule reads "commit after every change, but confirm with the owner first
when it's a milestone or has side effects"; the initial commit is ONE commit for the
whole scaffold (code + docs + AGENTS.md), message
`10_lcbnovel: Novelty-LCB Fe/MgO scaffold (repair of run 7) + governing AGENTS.md`.

### Actions taken
- Edited `AGENTS.md`: replaced the old "Do not commit without asking" rule with a
  new "Commit after every change" rule (confirm with owner for milestones/side
  effects), and renumbered the following rules.
- (This file) appended this Session 1c entry.
- Staged and committed the whole `10_lcbnovel/` directory as one commit.

### Results
- `AGENTS.md` now mandates committing every change.
- Initial commit created (see `git log -1`).

### Decisions & reasoning
- **One commit for the whole scaffold** (user's choice): the scaffold is a single
  coherent deliverable, so splitting code/docs would add noise without value.
- **Keep asking on milestones**: a blanket auto-commit could bury a large or
  side-effecting change without review; confirming at milestones keeps the owner in
  control while still ensuring routine changes are committed promptly.

### Open items / next steps
- Unchanged: calibrate energy window, then launch heavy HPC search.

### Time
~5 min.

## 2026-08-22 — Session 1d: Correction — HPC env + pjsub usage

### Goal (user correction)
1. Use **`gpaw_env`** for the HPC pjsub heavy run (not `agox_v2`).
2. Use **`pjsub j_novel.sh`** only — do **not** use `pjsub -x SEED=5 j_novel.sh`.
3. Remove the explanatory comment block from `j_novel.sh` (no long notes in the script).

Note: this **reverses** a decision recorded in Session 1 (which switched the batch
script to `agox_v2` and added a comment about the env mismatch). This entry is the
current, correct behaviour.

### Actions taken
- Rewrote `j_novel.sh`: no top comment block; `conda activate gpaw_env`; seed set by
  editing `SEED=3` at the top (hand-edited, run as `pjsub j_novel.sh`); `N_ITERATIONS=100`.
- Updated `README.md`: usage + decisions-table compute row (`gpaw_env`, `pjsub j_novel.sh`,
  seed via editing `SEED=`).
- Updated `README.AI.md`: pjsub usage + dependencies (local `agox_v2` vs HPC `gpaw_env`).
- Updated `TUTORIAL.md`: Step 4 (pjsub + seed editing + gpaw_env), pitfall #4 (env split),
  prerequisites (HPC uses `gpaw_env`).
- `AGENTS.md`: local env note unchanged (correct — agox_v2 is the local dev/test env).

### Results
- All docs now consistent: local dev/test = `agox_v2`; HPC pjsub = `gpaw_env`;
  launch via `pjsub j_novel.sh` with seed hand-edited in the script.

### Decisions & reasoning
- Keep the **local** smoke test / compile on `agox_v2` (that's this machine's env);
  only the **HPC** batch run uses `gpaw_env`. The two serve different purposes.
- Follow the owner's preference: no `-x` flag, no verbose comment block in `.sh`.

### Open items / next steps
- Unchanged: calibrate energy window, then launch heavy HPC search.

### Time
~10 min.

## 2026-08-22 — Session 1e: Explain Novelty-LCB method in README.md

### Goal (user request)
Owner added a Note block in `README.md` asking three conceptual questions about the
method: (1) what Novelty(x) is and whether it uses the 720-dim descriptor or PCA,
(2) what σ(x) is and how it is computed, (3) how a candidate is picked from a(x) and
how this compares to regular LCB in GOFEE. Owner asked to replace the Note with an
explanation. Confirmed via clarify: replace the Note block with a proper
"How the Novelty-LCB works" section in README.md, concise-but-complete, grounded in code.

### Actions taken
- Replaced the raw Note block (lines 18-23) in `README.md` with a new
  "## How the Novelty-LCB works" section answering all three questions, each citing
  the relevant code path in `novelty_lcb/acquisitor.py`:
  - Q1: Novelty(x) = min Euclidean distance in descriptor space; computed with the
    FULL 720-dim Fingerprint (no PCA); `descriptor.get_features(cand).ravel()` +
    `np.linalg.norm(db_feats - cand_feat, axis=1)`; empty DB => novelty 0.
  - Q2: σ(x) = GPR predictive std from `model.predict_energy_and_uncertainty`; kernel
    posterior uncertainty vs training points in 720-dim space.
  - Q3: AGOX sorts ascending, so code returns `-a(x)`; largest true a(x) picked first;
    out-of-window => +inf never selected; candidates pre-relaxed on LCB surface
    `E - kappa*sigma` (novelty has no force), then evaluated by GPAW.
  - Comparison: regular LCB = `mu - kappa*sigma` minimized (energy-exploit/explore);
    Novelty-LCB = `sigma + lambda*Novelty` maximized inside an energy window
    (diversity-focused); both share the LCB relaxation surface + GPR/Fingerprint stack.

### Results
- README.md now has a self-contained, code-grounded explanation of the method.
- Verified the section reads correctly and the Note block is gone.

### Decisions & reasoning
- Grounded every claim in the actual `acquisitor.py` implementation (not generic
  descriptions) so the README stays truthful and traceable to the code.
- Kept it in README.md (owner's choice) so a human reader gets the explanation in
  context without jumping to a separate doc.

### Open items / next steps
- Unchanged: calibrate energy window, then launch heavy HPC search.

### Time
~10 min.
